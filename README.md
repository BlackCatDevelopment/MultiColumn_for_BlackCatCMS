# MultiColumn for BlackCat CMS

With this add-on, different forms of display of text can be easily implemented. Static, dynamic and responsive designs are no longer a problem.

## Please notice

This release requires at least version 1.4.1 of BlackCat CMS. Please remember to run upgrade.php after updating the module, since a lot has changed in the database design!
As of BlackCat CMS 1.4, old variants of MultiColumn no longer work reliably. An update is strongly recommended.

For new installations under BlackCat CMS 1.4, the version in precheck.php can be adjusted accordingly. The add-on will then work without any problems.
